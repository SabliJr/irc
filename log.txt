IRC Operator Features Roadmap
1. Operator Management
Add operator tracking to your Channel class
Store a list/vector of operator clients (_operators)
When a channel is created, make the first client an operator
Implement functions:
addOperator(Client*)
removeOperator(Client*)
isOperator(Client*)
2. Operator Permissions
Before executing operator commands (KICK, INVITE, MODE, TOPIC if +t), check if the sender is an operator in the channel
If not, send error: 482 <nick> <channel> :You're not channel operator
3. KICK Command
Allow operators to remove users from a channel
Broadcast KICK message to channel
Remove client from channel
4. INVITE Command
Allow operators to invite users to invite-only channels
Track invited users
Send INVITE message to target user
5. TOPIC Command
Allow topic change by anyone, unless +t is set (then only operators)
Broadcast topic change
6. MODE Command
Support channel modes:
+i (invite-only)
+t (topic only by ops)
+k (set/remove password)
+o (give/take operator)
+l (set/remove user limit)
Parse mode string and parameters
Update channel state and broadcast changes
7. Testing and Validation
Test all commands with multiple clients
Check error handling and edge cases
Ensure only operators can use restricted commands
